Weekend Challenge Number 2- Server Side Calculator

## Description

For this project, I was tasked with creating a calculator that would take inputs from a user, send the data over to the server, complete the calculations on the server side, and then return the final output back to the client side and display it on the DOM. In order to complete this, I used a series of post and get requests. Two of the extra features that I added were an alert that pops up when the user attempts to submit blank input fields, which maintains data integrity, and a number formatter that formats the resulting answer nicely with proper commas for easier readability for the user.
